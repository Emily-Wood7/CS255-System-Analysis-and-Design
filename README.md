# System-Analysis-and-Design

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project.  Who was the client?  What type of system did they want you to design?**
DriverPass wants to better prepare students for their driving tests.
DriverPass noticed a void in the market for training students to pass their driving tests at the DMV.
Increase pass rates at the DMV.
Make scheduling easier through automation

**What did you do particularly well?**
I think I was able to understand my audience and explain things in non-technical ways for easy understanding.

**If you could one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick?  How would you improve it?**
I would improve my skills with diagrams.  I feel like I may have left pieces out and with more time or further interviews with the client, I could have made them more robust.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design?  Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
The stakeholders of DriverPass were very explicit in their needs.  The interview given provided great insight into the requirements of the system they needed.  We need to always consider a user’s needs because ultimately, they are the ones paying for the product, may send new business, and become repeat business.

**How do you approach designing software?  What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
I first want to get to know the client and understand their purpose.  I will use the techniques of interviewing with recordings.  Asking open ended and clarifying questions.  It is important to find out what their requirements are, what they want a system to do, what time frame they have, and what their goals are for the future.
